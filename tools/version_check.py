"""Shared logic for VERSION's bump requirement (proposal 32, V-02).

Imported by both `bin/version-check` (reports and `--check`s) and
`tests/test_version.py`, the same shape `tools/workflow_stamp.py` uses for
`bin/workflow-stamp` and `tests/test_workflow_stamp.py` (proposal 31,
O-12): one implementation of "what does the CHANGELOG require", not two
computing it independently and drifting apart on the answer.

THE MARKER FOR WHERE THE LAST RELEASE IS: VERSION's own git history, not a
tag or a CHANGELOG heading. Specifically, `last_release_commit()` is the
oldest commit in the run of commits (walking back from HEAD) whose VERSION
blob already equals HEAD's -- the commit that most recently set VERSION to
its current value. This needs no separate bookkeeping a session can forget
to update: VERSION already changes exactly when a release happens (that is
what "bump the version" means), so the marker and the event it marks are
the same fact, the way `rulecheck`'s STAMP is the same fact as "aligned".
A git tag was considered and rejected: proposal 32's V-04 (tagging 1.0.0)
is a separate, deliberately rare act the lead performs on a green main, and
gating every ordinary PR's merge on a tag existing would block all of them
until that one act happens. A CHANGELOG heading was also considered and
rejected: it is a second, hand-written fact about the same commit VERSION
already names, free to drift from it the way the count-sha stamp drifted
from committed reality before `rulecheck` existed.

MISSING MARKER: when `VERSION` is not tracked in git at all (a checkout
that predates V-01, or the file was deleted without committing that),
there is no commit to diff from. `required_bump()` refuses -- state
"could not check" -- rather than reporting "none pending", which would
tell a session nothing is required when the truth is unknown.

THE BUMP RULE (CLAUDE-workflow.md, "Changing these rules" / the version
stamp section):
  MAJOR  -- breaks a project already following the rules: a tool removed
            or renamed, a declaration whose absence now fails a gate, a
            rule reversed. Declared explicitly, with a second marker line
            in the CHANGELOG entry, MAJOR_MARKER below -- never inferred
            from prose. A wrong guess here is the one mistake that matters:
            it would silently tell every adopting project a breaking change
            is safe to ignore.
  MINOR  -- any entry carrying MANDATORY_MARKER (rulecheck's own marker,
            proposal 21 S-09). A project must now do something it did not
            have to before, but nothing it already does breaks.
  PATCH  -- everything else that shipped: a new tool nobody must use, a
            fix, wording.
A MAJOR entry is also, in substance, a Standard change -- it asks an
adopting project to do something (stop relying on what broke) -- so it
should normally carry MANDATORY_MARKER too. This module does not require
that pairing; it only reads MAJOR_MARKER to decide the bump is MAJOR
rather than MINOR. Pairing them is what makes rulecheck's own mandatory
gate list the entry for adopting projects to implement.
