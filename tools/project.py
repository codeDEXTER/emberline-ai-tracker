"""The project declaration: `.common-rules.json` (proposal 20, D9).

The standard used to assume every project reads HANDOFF.md first, keeps its
prohibitions under a HANDOFF heading containing "prohibition", and has one
test gate. The PhotoVault app does none of that -- CLAUDE.md is its entry
point, its safety rules sit under "## Hard safety rules", and it has a quick
gate and a merge gate -- so its warm card said "Prohibitions: none found" over
five NEVER rules, and its warm-up pointer contradicted its own read order. A
project now says where its entry points are, and the tools read that.

THE FILE -- `.common-rules.json` at the project root, beside
`.common-rules-version`. A JSON object. Every key is optional, and a key this
module does not know is ignored, because later proposals add keys.

  "read_order":   ["CLAUDE.md", "SPONSOR-CONSTRAINTS.md"]
      Files a session reads first, in order. Not empty.
      Default: ["HANDOFF.md", "docs/OPERATING-RULES.md"].
  "safety_rules": "CLAUDE.md#Hard safety rules"     (or a list of these)
      FILE#heading: the `## ` section of FILE whose heading text contains
      `heading`, case-insensitive. Its list items and bold-numbered lines are
      the card's prohibitions, verbatim. Split at the first "#".
      Default: "HANDOFF.md#prohibition".
  "gates":        {"quick": "<cmd>", "merge": "<cmd>"}
      merge is what bin/land runs before it lands; quick is the gate an agent
      runs. Each is a non-empty, one-line command, trimmed. Default: {}. With
      no "merge" key here, the first non-blank, non-comment line of
      `.common-rules-test` is gates.merge -- that file keeps working.
  "plan_check":   "<cmd>"   the project's own plan checker. Default: None.
  "plan_page":    "<cmd>"   the project's own page generator. Default: None.
  "proposal_series": ["../engine"]
      Sibling projects that share this project's proposal number series --
      the PhotoVault app and engine interleave theirs across two repos. Each
      entry is a one-line path relative to the project root that stays
      inside the project's parent folder (so `..` is allowed here, and only
      here), is not the project itself, exists, and holds docs/proposals.
      bin/new-proposal numbers across all of them. Default: [].
  "value_defaults": {"tracker": "high", "docs": "low"}
      Proposal 25, Z-03: the value (high|medium|low) an item takes from its
      `cluster` when it has no `value` of its own. Default: {}.
  "risk_paths":   {"restricted": ["finance_data/*"], "elevated": ["shared/*"]}
  "risk_always":  "restricted"
      Proposal 25, Z-04: path globs that set an item's risk class, and a
      floor no path lowers (common-rules declares restricted, D4). Read by
      tools/tracker/risk.py. Defaults: {} and None.
  "ruflo_namespace": "patterns"
      RF-01: the Ruflo memory namespace this project's existing memories use.
      A non-empty, one-line string. Read by tools/ruflo.py's namespace_for(),
      which every Ruflo-facing tool (bin/ruflo-item, bin/warmup, bin/
      conformance item 9) now shares -- --namespace, then $RUFLO_NAMESPACE,
      then this key, then the project directory's own name. Default: None.

EVERY VALUE IS UNTRUSTED. A path is relative to the project root: an absolute
path, a `..` part, or a path that resolves (through a symlink) outside the
project is a problem, and no declared path outside the project is read or hashed
(the default HANDOFF.md, ledgers and checkpoint are read as before). Every
path and command is one line -- no control character -- because a command is
eval'd by land and every value can be printed on the card, where a line break
would run a second command or forge a line. And every string must be valid
UTF-8: JSON can carry a lone surrogate ("\\udc80") that no output can print,
so it is a named problem, never a traceback. No problem message quotes a value
that failed one of these checks.

WHO READS IT
  bin/land test_cmd()  gates.merge, else .common-rules-test, else a guess from
                       the tree. It is bash and must stay self-contained, so it
                       carries its own few lines of json reading, run as
                       `python3 -I` so a project's own json.py cannot answer for
                       the standard library. test_command() below is its twin,
                       and tests pin the two equal.
  bin/warmup           read_order, safety_rules, gates, problems(), inside().
  tools/migrate.py     read_order, for the pointer it writes into CLAUDE.md --
                       and it writes nothing while problems() has anything to say.
  bin/new-proposal     proposal_series(), to number across sibling projects; it
                       refuses to run while the series has a problem.

A BROKEN DECLARATION. load() never raises: a file that is not valid JSON, or
not an object, gives the defaults, and a value that fails a check leaves that
key's default standing. problems() names each one, and warm-up's --check
fails on them.

A gate is different, because running the wrong one is worse than running
none. land -- and test_command() -- refuse with `false  # <why>` when the file
is not valid JSON, is not an object, has "gates" that is not an object, or
declares a "merge" or "quick" gate that is not a non-empty string, is not
valid UTF-8, or is not one line (lead rulings on V-00, 14 Sep). Nothing falls
back to .common-rules-test or the guess: that would silently run a gate nobody
declared. load() does not fill in a declared but broken gates.merge either. To
run the merge gate, ask test_command(), never load()["gates"]["merge"] -- only
the first carries the refusal.

  load(project)         -> dict       the declaration merged over the defaults
  declared(project)     -> dict       only the keys the file validly declares
  problems(project)     -> list[str]  what is wrong with the declaration
  test_command(project) -> str        what bin/land's test_cmd() answers
  inside(project, rel)  -> bool       rel resolves inside the project
  proposal_series(project) -> ([(rel, path)], [problem])   usable siblings, or the problems
