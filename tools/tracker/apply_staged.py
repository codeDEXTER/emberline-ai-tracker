"""tracker apply-staged -- the dispatcher applies every builder's staged
change to a ledger, one at a time (proposal 23, M-04: one writer for ledger
and tracker files).

  tracker apply-staged LEDGER

Reads every file under LEDGER's sibling `.staging/` directory named
`<ledger stem>__*.json` (a `tracker stage` record), oldest first by its own
`at` field, and applies each with the same validated write `tracker set`
uses -- one item at a time, so two staged changes to the same item apply in
the order they were staged rather than racing. A staged file that applies
cleanly is deleted; one that fails (unknown item, or the ledger would not
validate after the change) is left in place and reported, and the run
still applies the rest.

This is meant to run only in the dispatcher's own worktree, against the
integration branch, after merging in a builder's branch -- never in an item
lead's own worktree.

Exit codes: 0 every staged file applied (or none were pending), 1 at least
one staged file failed and was left in place, 2 the ledger could not be
read.
